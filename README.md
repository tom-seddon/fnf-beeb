See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogs_and_Flies

# how to build

## prerequisites

* [64tass](http://tass64.sourceforge.net/)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
* GNU Make
* Some kind of Unix (this will improve!)

## build process

Type `make`

The code builds to `build/fnf-2600.bin` in the working copy, which
should exactly match `Frogs and Flies (USA).a26` from the repo.
